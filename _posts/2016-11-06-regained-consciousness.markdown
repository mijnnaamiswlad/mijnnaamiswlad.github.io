I am sort of sorry for abandoning this for a while. Somewhat about 40/60 'yes' and 'no' correspondingly.

The reason is simple - these two months were strapped to the teeth with events, occurencies and cosequently new people. I skimmed through my last post where I was desperately asking heavens to descend a job for me. Well, I got one now.

If you are reading this, then you probably know it already, but don't leave just yet - there will be something new for you as well. On Sept, 12 was offered a staff vacation in EY, one of the Big4 auditing firms. In October I began working, although it started with weeks of training, until somewhat in the end of the month I was assigned to an actual project. I work in the GFS sector - or global financial sector, which means my clients are mostly banks, insurance companies and the like. I am very content with this opportunity for two reasons: it pays well, it is the top career starter you can get here in Russia, imho, that is, and it revoked all that despair and uncertainty I had for a couple of years. 

You probably noticed that I miscalculated. I put the first two as one because those are typical, 'package-tour' terms of the job desired - I wouln't surprise anyone with words like 'I got a decent paying job and it works fine for me', since that's what all people aspire to do. What I didn't expect is that I regained 'thirst for life', dropped somewhen in 2014. I attribute this to the fact that in EY everything makes sense when you come to think of it (except for maybe its informational infrastructue - it is terrible). This whole logical dance ball just scratches the itch, y'know? Like I used to have a distracting and tiring rash, and now it's gone. I want to be engaged in new things, I want to become better, I want to to reach something I forlorn hopes about. It makes me feel new, refreshed. I know busy season is coming, so some might pose that as a challenge to me. I am not afraid, really, - I've been through storm long enough to build there a countryhouse with a pool and five bedrooms, guess you can save on the on the air conditioning. 

So I guess we can settle down here just for now, but keep looking out for new stuff. For science reasons, obviously.

Alongside with this I like my new programm in the U. Except for that one subject we always do have in every situaution which is really annoying, hard to neglect and you can't around it or burned it to the ground. I met a lot of new people, some of them were nice, some of them were not - they had to go and they left. I got a haircut - like today! - and it is snowing heavily in Moscow. I do realize I sound like the most stereotupical Russian, but damn I love it - way better than it used to be with the gritty November all spawning its warmth-sucking demons. At least it is beautiful now. 

So yeah, it seems like a new turn for me. We gotta see what that this train is having for us, and if it is good enough - we gotta jack it and turn into a plane. So far life seemed to me as something like this; you are too weak to make the world better and too subjective to understand why your 'better' is not better than the general 'better'. Simply enough, you just have to improve what is already there or create stuff which works more efficeintly than the other stuff. Nihil sub sole novum (est).

I am also happy to reunite with some old friends. Holla back at you, pals!

And I really want to revisit the US right now. Yet these plans have to wait, to my great displeasure.


Yours faifully,
Vlad, short for Vladislav

P.S. And my audit team is also quite nice. That's important, eh?
