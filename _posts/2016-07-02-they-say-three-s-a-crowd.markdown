That is my third time in a row - literally "waiting spree" - when the flight I am about to take turns delayed. 

Thankfully, this isn't Rimini case - had to sleep it over at the airport till early morning, before the birdie arrived. Nevertheless, meeting stars in the sky in the terminals becomes a habit of mine - although this is time it is cool, sponsored, air-conditioned habit.

I am about to take the most eastern trip - to the city of Shenzhen, China. Out of all trips, I've only been twice east of the place of living, but those were Irkutsk and Cheboksary, which is not, well... the East. I am excited and worried a little. Being quite a westerner, this whole lifestyle freaks me out, but juuust a little.

I am all good, fow now. I think I deserved a little rest.
