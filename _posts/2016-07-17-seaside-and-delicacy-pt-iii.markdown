After some time, I am back here. I have a few words left about China, some ongoing events in life, but I think that this schematics of writing large posts about lasting events doesn't prove itselef worthy. I think Chinese story will be the last of such kind, and I'll try to keep it updated on "as it happens" basis.

Today I will tell you about how awesome Chinese food is.

It is simply the best. Filling, delicious and cheap.

The key strategy in China's cuiusine journey is to pick places which seem the most vulgar. Not that clean and established restaurants do not serve good food - I'll give it a brisk observation as well - but you have to evade the European look-alikes. These are tourist baits and quite often expensive.

My first experience was not exactly Chinese - we went to a sushi bar somewhere off the main street. I used to be a sushi hater a couple of years ago as I could not understand how can one be fully nutrished with sushi. Times changed and I entered the place 100% sure that I will enjoy it. I was so far from right.

It was absolutely outstanding. That was the sushi which actually had taste. I realized immediately that there is no place in Moscow which can give you the same brightness and colour - and wasabi was actually biting, even the smallest drop. I have no idea what has to do with it, freshness of the ingrdients or just the profound know-how, but every piece I placed in my mouth was a bit from heaven.

They say the best places to eat in China are trashed bistros. They are correct. I ordered noodles in a cafe Kubrick could use as a setting for the second half of Full Metal Jacket. The Chinese don't use the noodles we are used to - instead they have some sort of rice noodles probably. I never touched such in Russia, even with a pogo stick,  but inhere I was left without choice... and again, that was for the best. In China, all chefs are masters of the spices. They put them of so many kinds and in such amounts that you forget how disgusting raw food is. They are wizards - at some other joint we had an aubergine, all covered with some spices. I though it was chicken at first, it looked and tasted somewhat like it. Isn't that pure magic?

They are also quite good at desserts - except for traditional Chinese candy. You can have decent ice cream, cupcakes, pies and other western confectionairy - they are quite tasty. They also have some strange chain store, literaly called Baidu Ice Cream. Baidu is a Chinese alternative to Google - which is banned - and as a result you have Google Ice Cream. No idea why is that, however, it is excellent - for just 2 yuan which is about 20 rubles or 35 cents you can have a typical vanilla con, tasting like it was stolen from the divine fridge. 

Tea is obvioulsy popular in China. They get really creative - they combine the desserts and tea in the most unexpected way. We visited Royal Chu (which is Royal Tea) a few times, and they serve tea with some sort of special cheese and cream on it... which tastes as great as repelling it sounds. Seriously. IO would never believe that. And I did until I took a sip.

Of course, the actual restaurants in China do not let the whole thing down. I am really lost for words here. There is no way one can descrive those. Just imagine: beef in a sweet sauce with  cucumbers, salasd, onion, all of the served in a specially bakes pancake for the first and a huge fish in a honey sauce, so soft and delicate you can't resist it. I mean, this is life.

And the drumbeat - that last one cost us 110 yuan. Total. That is 1100 rubles or somewhat about $15-20.
For the sushi total was 50 yuan.
And for the filling noodles it was no more than 20 yuan. For two people.

Curtains close.
